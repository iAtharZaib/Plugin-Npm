## ‚ú® Integration


React-native-blob-util 


If react-native-blob-util exists then good, if react-native-blob exist delete it & install this one 

Add Kotlin dependency in appGradle 
```
ext {

kotlinVersion = '1.5.0'

}
```

Also include this 
```
dependencies {

classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlinVersion" //add this for rating plugin

}
```

If Android shows white screen, 
	1- delete node modules & re-install again
	2- do Gradlew clean and then run app


If audio doesn‚Äôt work in in iOS, we have to create a bridging header first.

```
Props Lang for Floating Rating
1 = Eng
